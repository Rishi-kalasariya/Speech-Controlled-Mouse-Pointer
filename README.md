## 1. 244101037_mouse_training_module

### Description
This module is designed to generate an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) from training data for each specific command. The resulting models are saved in separate files corresponding to each command. Additionally, this module generates a file named `Centroid_data.txt` that stores the final centroids of the codebook.

### Requirements
- Ensure that the following files are present in the project directory:
  - `PI.txt`
  - `Transition_matrix.txt`
  - `State_matrix.txt`

### Outputs
- HMM models for each command saved in separate files.
- `Centroid_data.txt` containing the final centroids of the codebook.

## 2. 244101037_testing_module

### Important Pre-run Instructions
Before running this module, ensure you copy the following files generated by the `244101037_mouse_training_module` into this project folder:
- All model files created for each command
- `Centroid_data.txt`

### Description
This module takes live input from the user and performs relevant operations to recognize the generated word based on the copied files mentioned above.
